## Installation & Updating
1. Download the mod
2. Copy the mod folder into your Bannerlord Modules folder, generally located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules.
3. Unblock all dll’s under mod folder.
4. (Optional) If not using MCM, configure the mod via the config.xml located in the mod folder (after launching the game once).

For updating please delete the mod folder and follow the installation process again.

## Configuration
### Mod Configuration Menu
Configuration is done in game via Mod Configuration Menu(MCM) or via config.xml to keep requirements down. Make sure to adjust your config, all values are generally disabled by default or set to vanilla settings.

### Non Mod Configuration Menu
If not using MCM the config.xml is located in the mod folder. It will be automatically created after the first run, then you can configure.

## FAQs
Is it save game compatible?
Can be added or removed from any save game but always backup your saves before attempting any game/save modification.

Im not using Mod Configuration Menu(MCM) where is the config.xml?
Due to constinate changes the config.xml is created at runtime. Thus, you will need to launcht the game once after installing the mod for the config.xml to generate. The config.xml will then be located in the root of the mod folder, generally located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules\BetterAttributes.
